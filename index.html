        	Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. This should be interesting. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. They were just sucked into space. Computer, belay that order. The unexpected is our normal routine. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Travel time to the nearest starbase? How long can two people talk about nothing? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. You enjoyed that. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Computer, lights up! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Damage report! Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. I am your worst nightmare! I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. What? We're not at all alike! But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Not if I weaken first. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Your head is not an artifact! Besides, you look good in a dress. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Your shields were failing, sir. Ensign Babyface! Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Talk about going nowhere fast. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! and attack the Romulans. Well, that's certainly good to know. We have a saboteur aboard. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Sorry, Data. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I'll be sure to note that in my log. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. I'll alert the crew. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation.
